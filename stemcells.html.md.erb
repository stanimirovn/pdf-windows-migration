## <a id="stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells

A BOSH stemcell is a versioned OS image wrapped with IaaS-specific packaging.
BOSH uses a stemcell to supply the basic OS for any Windows VM it creates.
A typical BOSH stemcell for Windows contains the following:

* A bare minimum Windows OS skeleton.
* A BOSH Agent.
* OS Configuration files and common utilities.

For more information about stemcells, see [What is a Stemcell?](https://bosh.io/docs/stemcell/)
in the Cloud Foundry BOSH documentation.
